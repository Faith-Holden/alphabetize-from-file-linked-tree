# alphabetize-from-file-linked-tree

My solution for Chapter 9 Exercise 2 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.
Implementation notes: The main implemenation for this problem was editing the SortTreeDemo.java
class provided by the textbook's author. I added a method to sort words from the file and removed 
the method to get user input.

Problem Description:
Exercise 7.6 asked you to read a file, make an alphabetical list of all the words that occur
in the file, and write the list to another file. In that exercise, you were asked to use an
ArrayList<String> to store the words. Write a new version of the same program that stores
the words in a binary sort tree instead of in an arraylist. You can use the binary sort tree
routines from SortTreeDemo.java, which was discussed in Subsection 9.4.2.
